      <description>We, once again, participated in the NorthSec competition. This article is about the DOOM challenge which was pretty interesting as you had to validate it at the VR station. actgardner already made a write-up that you can find here. I wanted to complete it and show another solution that icecr4ck and I came up with.
Tearing the game apart In order to navigate through the map I used GZDoom builder and loaded the zoombies.</description>

      <description>In May 2018, the NorthSec conference and its on-site CTF competition were held. Once again the competition was awesome, the challenges were very diverse and the infrastructure was well configured. One of the reverse engineering challenges was a program called MarsAnalytica. This challenge remained unsolved at the end of the CTF. This binary was worth a lot of points and I think it was the right amount of points due to the time one would have to spend to solve it.</description>
