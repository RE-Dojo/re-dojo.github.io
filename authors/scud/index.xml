      <description>We, once again, participated in the NorthSec competition. This article is about the DOOM challenge which was pretty interesting as you had to validate it at the VR station. @actgardner already made a write-up that you can find here. I wanted to complete it and show another solution that icecr4ck and I came up with.
Tearing the game apart     In order to navigate through the map I used GZDoom builder and loaded the zoombies.</description>

      <description>In May 2018, the NorthSec conference and its on-site CTF competition were held. Once again the competition was awesome, the challenges were very diverse and the infrastructure was well configured. One of the reverse engineering challenges was a program called MarsAnalytica. This challenge remained unsolved at the end of the CTF. This binary was worth a lot of points and I think it was the right amount of points due to the time one would have to spend to solve it.</description>
